Change Log

0.3.4:
Added specular support, use the specular power to adjust, and make sure to set the color to something other than pure black.
Changed Panosphere to Overlays.  Panospheres will still be available, but will be able to be blended in multiple ways.
Added UV scrolling overlays, these use the same new blend modes as panospheres, enjoy!
Issues:
Interface might "forget" you have a panosphere set.  Click the Overlay Mode dropdown to select again.

0.3.3.1:
Removed a warning in the editor

0.3.3:
Added stencil support
Added lighting color options
Added custom blending support

0.3.2:
Added ability to shade your emission like the rest of your model
Added ability to turn off emission below a certain light level
Added gamma correction, this can help fix washed out models

0.3.1:
Added another level of transparent fix since one seems not to have been enough, I may add a few more in the future.  This will remove your fix setting in the inspector
Spotlights fixed, lighting should look amaze in forward add, directional lights beware
Shadow intensity slider will no longer work, at least for now, functionality will be determined when I find out if it's needed

0.3.0:
Added a fix for light textures not drawing correctly, this affects point lights, spot lights, and shadow casts
Now you can disable the overbright protection code I added, this is recommended when you bump the shadow cast intensity up
Panospheres added, you can define a panosphere and even overlay it
Known Issues:
Flat panospheres, screen mode, don't work at all, do not use

0.2.8.3:
Actually fixed outline lighting, turns out it only was affected in certain worlds.

0.2.8.2:
Fixed a bug with outlines, especially colored outlines, they should appear more colored and less black now.
Fixed a bug where HSB mode would only apply to the forward pass, this should give more consistent colors.

0.2.8.1:
Fixed unity package, forgot to include the editor, sorry guys!

0.2.8:
You can now oversaturate your models! Saturation boost added.
HSB mode! Now you can change the color of your textures completely within your materials!

0.2.7:
Fixed how sphere textures apply, should look better than before this broke (thanks Unity for that)
Improve support for double sided transparent textures, will now render in two separate passes

0.2.6:
Bug fix: Certain materials that had a redefinition error are now fixed

0.2.5:
Changed info text for toon textures and shadow ramps
(Breaking change) Split shader in order to specify explicit render queue settings for VRChat
Transparency Fix will set render queue up in order to combat render queue fights in VRChat
Shadows now appear on opaque and cutout render modes
Lighting hacks adjusted and improved, fixed
Lighting hacks are now hybrid by default
Lighting hacks now have an override for realtime lighting

0.2.4:
Added lighting hack choice
None is normal lighting, will work anywhere
VRChat is for worlds with light direction coordinates 0,0,0 which causes everything to be shadowed and I don't want that.
Static lets you choose a static light coordinate, relative to the model.  This will work everywhere but may look incorrect

2018/6/28
Lighting hack is now much more subtle
Added description text to most controls

2018/6/26
Added outline modes!
Screenspace outlines!
Started writing this log in the first place, I should have done this a long time ago
