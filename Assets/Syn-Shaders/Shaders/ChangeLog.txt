Change Log

0.2.8:
You can now oversaturate your models! Saturation boost added.
HSB mode! Now you can change the color of your textures completely within your materials!

0.2.7:
Fixed how sphere textures apply, should look better than before this broke (thanks Unity for that)
Improve support for double sided transparent textures, will now render in two separate passes

0.2.6:
Bug fix: Certain materials that had a redefinition error are now fixed

0.2.5:
Changed info text for toon textures and shadow ramps
(Breaking change) Split shader in order to specify explicit render queue settings for VRChat
Transparency Fix will set render queue up in order to combat render queue fights in VRChat
Shadows now appear on opaque and cutout render modes
Lighting hacks adjusted and improved, fixed
Lighting hacks are now hybrid by default
Lighting hacks now have an override for realtime lighting

0.2.4:
Added lighting hack choice
None is normal lighting, will work anywhere
VRChat is for worlds with light direction coordinates 0,0,0 which causes everything to be shadowed and I don't want that.
Static lets you choose a static light coordinate, relative to the model.  This will work everywhere but may look incorrect
