0.2.4:
Added lighting hack choice
None is normal lighting, will work anywhere
VRChat is for worlds with light direction coordinates 0,0,0 which causes everything to be shadowed and I don't want that.
Static lets you choose a static light coordinate, relative to the model.  This will work everywhere but may look incorrect
