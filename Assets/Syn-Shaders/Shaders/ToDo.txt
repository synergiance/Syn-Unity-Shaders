To Do:

Effects:
Primary effects, rainbow, wave rainbow, texture swap
Secondary effects, overlay
Outline effects, rainbow, wave rainbow (texture swap already needs to swap the outline)

Add ambient light back
Add toon ramp as a different texture type
Find a way to make sphere slots share a texture
Texture encoded settings for atlased models
Possibly more description
Change the way lighting is applied, more passes, hopefully this doesn't backfire (probably not)
When lighting is static and no static lights are around set shadow to full brightness
