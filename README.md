# Synergiance Shaders for Unity
This is a toon shader for Unity, which was designed to recreate the look and feel of Miku Miku Dance.  It has many more features, some new, some old, that help it get along in the various worlds of VRChat.

## Download

## How to import
Go to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...` and browse to where you saved the unitypackage, click Import, and wait for Unity to calculate changes on your project.  Click Import.  Unity will take a moment before becoming responsive again.  You do not need to restart Unity for changes to take effect.
